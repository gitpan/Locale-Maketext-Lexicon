This is the README file for Locale::Maketext::Lexicon, a module providing
lexicon-handling backends, for "Locale::Maketext" to read from other
localization formats, such as PO files, MO files, or from databases via
the "Tie" interface.

You can also read my presentation "Web Localization in Perl" online at
http://www.autrijus.org/webl10n/.  It gives an overview for the localization
process, features a comparison between Gettext, Msgcat and Maketext, and
talks about my experiences at localizing web applications based on HTML::Mason
and the Template Toolkit.

* Installation

Locale::Maketext::Lexicon uses the standard perl module install process:

cpansign -v             # see the SIGNATURE file for details
