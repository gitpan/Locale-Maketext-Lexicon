This is the README file for Locale::Maketext::Lexicon, a module providing
lexicon-handling backends, for "Locale::Maketext" to read from other
localization formats, such as PO files, MO files, or from databases via
the "Tie" interface.

For extracting translatable strings from source files, a "xgettext.pl"
utility is also installed by default.

You can also read my presentation "Web Localization in Perl" in the docs/
directory.  It gives an overview for the localization process, features
a comparison between Gettext, Msgcat and Maketext, and talks about my
experiences at localizing web applications based on HTML::Mason and the
Template Toolkit.

* Installation

Locale::Maketext::Lexicon uses the standard perl module install process:

    cpansign -v         # optional; see the SIGNATURE file for details
    perl Makefile.PL
    make                # or 'nmake' on Win32
    make test
    make install
