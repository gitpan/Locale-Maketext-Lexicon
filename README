This is the README file for Locale::Maketext::Lexicon, a module providing
lexicon-handling backends, for "Locale::Maketext" to read from other
localization formats, such as PO files, MO files, or from databases via
the "Tie" interface.

For extracting translatable strings from source files, a "xgettext.pl"
utility is also installed by default.

You can also read my presentation "Web Localization in Perl" online at
http://www.autrijus.org/webl10n/.  It gives an overview for the localization
process, features a comparison between Gettext, Msgcat and Maketext, and
talks about my experiences at localizing web applications based on HTML::Mason
and the Template Toolkit.

* Installation

Locale::Maketext::Lexicon uses the standard perl module install process:

cpansign -v             # see the SIGNATURE file for details
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install
